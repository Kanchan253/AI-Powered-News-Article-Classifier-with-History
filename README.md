## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a web application that classifies news articles into categories and keeps track of past classification requests. The application should take a news article URL as input, scrape the article content, predict its category using an AI model, store the request and the prediction in a database, and display the predicted category as well as a history of past classification requests.

## User Interface[(Front-End)](./front-end)
